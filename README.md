Sure! Below is a simple code example for a "School Trip Form" created with HTML and styled with CSS. The form allows users to enter personal details, select a destination, and choose additional options.


Explanation:
HTML Structure:

The form is contained within a <div class="form-container"> for styling purposes.
The form elements include input, select, radio, and checkbox elements to capture the necessary details such as the student's name, grade, email, trip destination, transportation choice, and additional options like snacks or water bottles.
A submit button is provided to submit the form.
CSS Styling:

Basic styling is applied to make the form look clean and modern.
The form container has padding, a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow to make it stand out.
Input fields and labels are styled with sufficient spacing and borders for better readability.
The submit button has a green background, and a hover effect is added to make it interactive.
